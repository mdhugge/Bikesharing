# Bikesharing

## Overview of the Analysis
An analysis of the citi bike-sharing in New York City in order to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a great investment. Tableau is used to present an analysis of the bike-sharing data from New York City, so that investors know what they are getting themselves into.  

## Results

### Checkout Times for Users
![NYC Bike Sharing.png](https://github.com/mdhugge/Bikesharing/blob/main/Images/NYC%20Bike%20Sharing.png)

Most riders checked out bikes for less than 20 minutes. This could mean that destinations in New York City are close by and so checking out a bike for a short period of time is convenient and physically sustainable. 

### Checkout Times by Gender
![NYC Bike Sharing (1).png](https://github.com/mdhugge/Bikesharing/blob/main/Images/NYC%20Bike%20Sharing%20(1).png)

There are more males checking out bikes and males generally check out their bikes for longer period of time. After 1 hour this levels off and there is no difference between genders. 

### Trips by Weekday per Hour

During the weekdays usage seems to be the greatest around 7-10am and then again 5-7pm this is probably in line with work hours. The morning rush is due to everyone getting in to work and the evening rush is due to everyone finishing work. In comparison, on the weekend the use of bikes is steadier and there isn't really a certain time where the bikes are used most. This could be explained by the fact that on the weekend most people are not working.

### Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)

The times and genders are consistent with the two analyses above. Males checkout more bikes and during the weekdays most bikes are checked out around 7-10am and then again 5-7pm, whereas on the weekend the number of bikes checked out throughout the day is relatively steady. 

### User Trips by Gender by Weekday

Most people checking out bikes are subscribers and most are males. Of the males subscribed to the bike-sharing service most of them utilize the service on the weekdays. 

### August Peak Hours

The most popular time for the bike-sharing service is 5-6pm. 8 am is also a popular time for checking out bikes. These results are consistent with work hours and may be that most people are checking out bikes to get to and from work. 

### Top Starting Locations

The map shows the most popular starting location for the bike-sharing service. A circle that is larger and a darker shade of blue is a more popular starting location. The top starting locations are in central New York City. 

## Summary
The visualizations above show that the bike-sharing service in New York City is successful due to the proximity of destinations and the residents of New York City utilizing the bike-sharing service to commute to and from work. It does not appear that the success is due to tourism. 

Two additional visualizations that would be useful in interpreting the data would be:
- A heat map of Trips by Age (Weekday per Hour), this would allow us to see what age group is using the bike-sharing service the most during the week. This would help clarify if the age of those using the bike service most are those the would be classified as the working class. 
- A visualizations of the Checkout Times by Location would also be useful to see which areas of the city have longer commutes and how this corresponds to number of people accessing the service.
